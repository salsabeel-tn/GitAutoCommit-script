# GitAutoCommit-script
This is a script that @UtkuHalis and I wrote to Automatically commit any changed files to a remote GitHub repository, we will soon be publishing it as a GitHub Action!<br> For now, feel free to place and run main.py in your repository's directory.
<br> Please raise an Issue or a PR in case you found a bug!
